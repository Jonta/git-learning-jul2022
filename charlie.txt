- git-commit:
- So `git commit -m "Title here" -m "1st paragraph" -m "2nd paragraph"`
  works

But:

I'd prefer the workflow
--- Enter command
--- vim pops up and lets us edit it
--- Close vim
--- That's now the commit message

- So what's the best command/setup for achieving that?
- iirc, there's some config-stuff one can do for it, but is that necessary?
